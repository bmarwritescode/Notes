   Why do we care? -> COST

   Scrimmage 2:
      - models are "predictive simulation"
      - consider timing, weight, maybe other data
      - supported platforms?

   Why do products fail?
      1) incomplete requirements
      2) lack of resources
      3) unrealistic goals
      4) changing specs
      5) lack of planning

   Generic Process:
      1) Discover
      2) Analyze
      3) Express

   if not written down, won't get built

   Verifiable(Testable)
      - can be verified in finite time

	Technical Design:
		- Modular Structure (functional or data units having well-defined I/O and properties)
		- Rationale for how this composition meets requirements (solves the problem)
		- Plan for construction	
		- Essential algorithms (as needed)	

	Prototyping:
		- A Disciplined experimental activity intended to reveal insights before design decisions are finalized
