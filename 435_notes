   Why do we care? -> COST

   Scrimmage 2:
      - models are "predictive simulation"
      - consider timing, weight, maybe other data
      - supported platforms?

   Why do products fail?
      1) incomplete requirements
      2) lack of resources
      3) unrealistic goals
      4) changing specs
      5) lack of planning

   Generic Process:
      1) Discover
      2) Analyze
      3) Express
